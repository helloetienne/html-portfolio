    <h1>Three Movies I Enjoyed Watching</h1>
    <h2>Here are three movies I'd watch again.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Amelie</h3>
    <p>
      Classic 2000s French romantic comedy/drama. We watched this in my AP
      French class and the teacher held up papers over the screen when that
      couple was screwing in the beginning. Then she thanked us for being mature
      about it.
    </p>
    <h3>Puss In Boots</h3>
    <p>
      I started watching this in October 2023 and never finished it, because I
      thought it was hilarious and wanted to re-watch it with my partner. BUT!
      We broke up. So now I suppose I'll finish it on my own.
    </p>
    <h3>The Emperor's New Groove</h3>
    <p>
      Disney classique. Chef's kiss. Recently learned this was supposed to be a
      more somber tale in the vein of Lion King and had Sting attached for the
      soundtrack. Haven't watched the documentary about this, but I guess some
      studio shenanigans happened, and we were blessed with the transcendental
      comedy stylings of Spade, Kitt, and Warburton.
