<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Etienne. I chose this name. I do understand and speak some French,
  but I'm not fluent. I was born in Kansas City, Missouri. I graduated high
  school in 2005 and attended the University of Missouri - Kansas City. I did
  not graduate from there. I moved to Chicago in 2017. Jobs I've worked include
  LTL dispatch, shoe department at JCPenney, accounting assistant, medical
  insurance data entry, bar code generation, and music tech. My last job was at
  Bandcamp as a tech support person, but they laid us off when they were bought.
  I've taught myself coding on and off throughout the years. After the layoffs,
  I knew that I wanted to finally pivot fully into full-stack competency. Mixed
  blessing, if you will. So here I am. Here are my projects. <br />
  <br />
  I also write, compose, and produce my own music. I use Logic Pro mostly and
  might use Ableton to perform. I play guitar, drums, bass, percussion, and
  synths. You can find me on Bandcamp and Soundcloud. <br /><br />
  I also have a dog son named Lenny Kravitz. According to Embark, he is lab,
  pit, assorted hound, and 100% cool cute guy. He looks like this.
